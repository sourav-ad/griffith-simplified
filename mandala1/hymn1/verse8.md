# Rigveda 1.1.8 — Hymn to Agni

## Simple English Rendering
You (Agni) are the one who presides over our sacrifices, who guards the eternal, everlasting Law and the One who is glowing, prospering in your own place of residence.

Ruler of sacrifices, guard of Law eternal, radiant One,
Increasing in thine own abode.

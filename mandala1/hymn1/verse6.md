# Rigveda 1.1.6 — Hymn to Agni

## Simple English Rendering
Agni, whatever blessing You choose to grant upon the devotee who serves you, is indeed the proof of the true nature of the Angiras (or same as the teachings and wisdom of the Angiras). 

Note: *Angiras* may refer to Agni Himself or an ancient lineage of sages.

Whatever blessing, Agni, thou wilt grant unto thy worshipper,
That, Aṅgiras, is indeed thy truth.

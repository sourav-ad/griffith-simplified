# Rigveda 1.2.7 — Hymn to Vayu

## Simple English Rendering
Mitra, who has divine strength, I urge you to come to us. I also urge Varuna, who destroys our enemies. Mitra and Varuna complete this ritual where we pour oil into fire.

Mitra, of holy strength, I call, and foe-destroying Varuṇa,
Who make the oil-fed rite complete.

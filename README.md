# Griffith simplified
This is an attempt and an ongoing project to create simple English rendering of the Vedas based on Ralph T.H. Griffithâ€™s public domain English translation. The aim of this work is to make the Vedas accessible to everyone. 

Any unintended misinterpretations are regretted!

Disclaimer: I am not a Vedic or Sanskrit scholar. This is purely out of my passion and hobby.
